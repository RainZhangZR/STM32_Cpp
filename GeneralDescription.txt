  
  This program is written by Rain Zhang, Luoyang Institute of Information
Technology Industries (LYZK) in 2018.
  This program is written and compiled in C++ language. So it can use the 
advantage of C++ language, such as reuse, encapsulation and inheritance.
  There are three complicated data type: enum, struct and class. All these
complicated data type is named in CamelCase style. The name of class adds 
a prefix "Lyzk", but enum and struct do not.
  Every function needs return a code indicates the result of the function, 
except Set or Reset functions. The return code has a prefix of "LYZK_" and 
a suffix of "_ERR". The general return code is LYZK_FAILED (0) and 
LYZK_SUCCESSED (1).
  You should define some CONSTANT:
    1. Define your device's package in "userdef.h" file and inlude "userdef.h"
file in your "main.cpp" file.
    If your device is a 36-pin device, you should define LYZK_STM32F10X_36PIN
in UserDef.h file.
    If your device is a 48-pin device, you should define LYZK_STM32F10X_48PIN
in UserDef.h file.
    If your device is a 64-pin device, you should define LYZK_STM32F10X_64PIN
in UserDef.h file.
    If your device is a 100-pin device, you should define LYZK_STM32F10X_100PIN
in UserDef.h file.
    If your device is a 144-pin device, you should define LYZK_STM32F10X_144PIN
in UserDef.h file.
    
    2. Define whether use "printer" to output debug message.
    The "printer" uses USART1 as the peripheral, baud rate is 115200, no
hardware flow control, no parity, word length is 8.
